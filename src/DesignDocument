public (main)(String name, int crit rate, int health, int speed, int strength, int fortitude, int potion) {

First it'll print instructions on how the game is played then require the user to input a name, an artifact of choice, a potion of choice, and distribute given attribute points.
Then it'll store the health and other stats in an object.
Under a for statement which'll continue until a user's health reaches 0 or below or until the set amount of rounds is exceeded.
The users will be prompted to either input a (attack), d (defend), c (consume), or p (parry). If both users attack they will trade hits and both deal damage, if one user attacks and the second one defends
the damage will be determined by the attacking players attack stat and the defending players fortitude. If one user attacks and the other parries, the attacking user will be stunned, but if the parrying user doesn't get
attacked he will be stunned. There will also be a chance for every time a user attacks for it to be a crit and it'll do increased damage. If a user attacks more than a certain amount of times their attacks will weaken and
their damage will be debuffed until they choose another move.
